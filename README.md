## Welcome to Gateway to Apshai X

Gateway to Apshai X is the remake of the action-adventure game for the Commodore 64, ColecoVision and Atari 8-bit family, developed by The Connelley Group and published by Epyx as a prequel to Temple of Apshai. It is a more action-oriented version of Temple of Apshai, with smoother and faster graphics routines, more intuitive controls, fewer role-playing video game elements, and fewer room descriptions. The remake can be downloaded from the play store and played on Android devices.

### Source code

The application is developed in Java with LibGDX library and you find the necessary source code in this repository. You need the Android Studio (currently Version 3.4) to compile, build and run. Build management is done with gradle plugin.

Few of the art is taken from Wesnoth https://www.wesnoth.org/, the game specific art is taken from the decompilation of Kroah http://bringerp.free.fr/RE/
